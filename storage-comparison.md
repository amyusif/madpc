# File Storage Service Comparison

## Current Setup (Firebase Storage + Supabase Storage)

### Issues:
- **Complex Configuration** - Multiple bucket setups, CORS policies
- **Firebase Dependency** - Requires Firebase project even if using Supabase
- **Mixed Storage** - Files split between Firebase and Supabase
- **Manual Optimization** - No automatic image processing
- **Limited File Processing** - Basic upload/download only

## Recommended: UploadThing

### âœ… Advantages:
- **Next.js Native** - Built specifically for Next.js applications
- **Zero Configuration** - Works out of the box
- **Automatic CDN** - Global file delivery with edge caching

- **Type Safety** - Full TypeScript support with file router
- **Better DX** - Excellent developer experience and debugging
- **Cost Effective** - 2GB free, then $0.10/GB
- **File Processing** - Built-in image transformations
- **Security** - Automatic file scanning and validation

### ðŸ“Š Pricing Comparison:
- **UploadThing**: 2GB free, $0.10/GB after
- **Firebase Storage**: 1GB free, $0.026/GB after (but requires Firebase project)
- **Supabase Storage**: 1GB free, $0.021/GB after

## Alternative Options Considered

### 1. Cloudinary
